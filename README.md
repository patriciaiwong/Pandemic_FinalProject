# Pandemic Analysis

Group project:

Analysis and trend visualizations of COVID-19 data using Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, Plotly, JavaScript, D3, Tableau and HTML/CSS. We examined the amount of cases and deaths that have been reported for every country, as well as compared the amount of cases per state within the United States. Moreover, we compared the gender demographics and death rates for people infected with this virus.

## Machine Learning Models:

Four models were created using supervised machine learning to analyze the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths/recovered cases for all countries, as well as the relationship between deaths and gender. Using linear regression and calculating the R-squared score, the relationship between these values was determined.

## Gender Comparison Using D3:

A scatterplot was created using JavaScript and D3 to compare the gender demographics and the total deaths for countries China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy and Spain. D3 was used for animations, transitions, click events on the y labels, and tooltips when the cursor hovers over the circles.

## Comparison of Confirmed Cases, Deaths and Recovered Cases Worldwide Using Tableau:

Three graphs were created using Tableau to compare the total amount of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases worldwide. A fourth graph was created to compare the same factors for the countries with the highest numbers: China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Spain and the U.S.

## Map of Cases in the U.S. Using JavaScript:

A dynamic table that displays the county, state, number of cases, deaths, latitude and longitude for the U.S. was created using JavaScript. The table can be filtered by state and county.

## Tracker and live Update: 

A visualization of cases around the world was created using a Plotly map. Also, a live-update that tracks the number of cases, deaths, recovered cases, new cases and new deaths for every country using an API.
